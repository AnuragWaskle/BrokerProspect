SECTION 1: THE CHALLENGE
### Inconsistent Processes Kill Growth

You're scaling your team, but:

Every producer works differently. New hires take months to ramp up. 
Senior producers guard their processes. Quality varies across accounts. 
Client experience is inconsistent.

You need systems that scale—not just more people.

### Standardized Workflows Across Your Team

every time.

of who's handling the account.

- Growth limited by hiring and training capacity

After Broker Agentx:
- New producers productive within days
- Consistent quality and professionalism across all accounts
- Senior producers focused on relationships and complex risks
